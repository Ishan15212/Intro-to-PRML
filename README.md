. Fitting 2D linear model to N > 2 training points (30 points)
(a) During the lectures we started to derive solutions for the parameters a and b of the linear model
y = ax + b and when there are N training data samples {(x1, y1),(x2, y2), . . . ,(xN , yN )}.
You should finish the derivation before testing it. Do not google, but allow yourself to do the math.
(b) Implement a Python function my linfit(x,y) that computes and returns a and b. Use your own
derivations in the function - no matter how “ugly” they are - to convince yourself about your super
powers.
(c) Write a Python program that asks user to give N points with a mouse (left click: add point, right
click: stop collecting) and then plots the points and a fitted linear model.
